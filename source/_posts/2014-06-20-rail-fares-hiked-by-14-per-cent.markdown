So first AccheDin guys! Here is the news that Railway fair can go up by 14.2%.

We heard that before election BJP govt said that [Train fare hike unacceptable](http://www.indiatvnews.com/politics/national/train-fare-hike-unacceptable-says-bjp-7621.html)

The hike — 14.2% in all classes of passenger fares and 6.5% in freight charges — is effective June 25 and will also apply to tickets purchased in advance for journeys commencing on or after that date. The difference in fare for such advance tickets will be collected by ticket examiners during the journey.
